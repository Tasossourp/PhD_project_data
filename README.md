## Repository for data production [DOI 10.1149/1945-7111/acef61](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/acef61)

The trajectories have not been provided. The data visualization has been produced in the jupyternb directory. 
The remaining directories are for data analysis (densities, rdf (radial distribution function), cdf(combined distribution function), hbonds (hydrogen bonds), densities). 
In each directory, a README file has been created where it is needed for data navigation.
